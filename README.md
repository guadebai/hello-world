# Hello-World

I was supposed to be a coder since 2014, however, I've always resisted of doing so.
As you can see, I created this account and this folder on 2017, way more late than my classmates, but add nothing into it since now.
Being a "fake" coder for nearly eight years, I have gradually "collected" skills of:
         1. C++        # I learned this at the first year of college, but almost never used that later
         2. Python     # I was supposed to learn that on my third year and forth year of my college, but "lazy student" as me, I end up learning it at the first semester of my graudate school when I had to do homework with that
         3. SQL.       # I learned this at the third year of my college. Good news, I grasped this skill quite well because I receievd much attention from my professor, or maybe because this skill is much easier than the other. Anyway, I went to an Internet company as the User Growth intern, where I wrote plenty of SQL and got good practice of it.
         4. JAVA.      # Actually I never wrote that before, and don't know how to wrote it. I have watched some course vedios before starting the work, hope this will help. I think I may learn how to wrote it during my work.
         5. HTML.      # I have read a book called "To learn HTML in 21 days", however, I gave up on the fifth day. Hope I can learn it during my work.
         6. Pyspark    # I leaned it on a course during my graduate school. I finished the homework and project queite well, but don't remember much now...
         7. Pytorch    # I used it also on one of my courses during my graduate school, but do I really know to use it? 
         8. Excel      # I used it quite often during my work in an Internet company before, I know how to do v-lookup, pivot table or other, I know how to make the report clean and tidy. Altought I can't do VBA, but I think that is enought for under most of the conditions.
         9. PowerPoint # As above, I used this quite often during my work before. I can make slides clean and official, but I don't think I am good at it, because I cannot do very well in creativity and logistics. 

Well, that is all about my professional skills.

As for now, I am experiencing being a software development engineer.
